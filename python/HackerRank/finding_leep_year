#An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, 
# and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

#In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

# The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
# The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
# The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

#Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. 
# If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

# Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.

def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    if year % 100 == 0: # divide the input by 100 (exception 1)
        if year % 400 == 0: #divide by 400 and check (exception 2)
            leap = True
        else:
            leap = False
    elif year % 4 == 0: # divide by 4 if a non-exceptional case
        leap = True
    
    return leap

year = int(input())
print(is_leap(year))

#Learnings: first, the exceptions have to be dealt with first. in the above code we divide the input by 100 so that the exception is taken care of
#           Second, we have to deal with multiple true statements and sort them out. for instance, 2000 is divisible by 400 and 100. This creates a clash which can be easily resolved 
#           by addin a simple nested conditional statement.
