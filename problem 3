#The provided code stub reads an integer, , from STDIN. For all non-negative integers i<n , print i^2.

#take user input
n = int(input())

for i in range(n):
    if i < n:
        print(i**2) #prints square of all the positive numbers less than n in each line.

#learnings: the if command is unnecesary as the range command ensures i<n
